## Part 2: Introduction to Data Analysis

### Supporting Lessons

* Anaconda

In this lesson, you will be getting a quick glimpse at the
Anaconda environment - one of the most popular
environments for doing data analysis in Python.

* Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for getting started with
writing python code. Though in production you often will write
code in scripts, notebooks are wonderful for sharing insights
and data viz!

* The Data Analysis Process

Learn about the data analysis process and practice
investigating different datasets using Python and its powerful
packages for data analysis.

* Data Analysis Process - Case Study 1

Investigate a dataset on chemical properties and quality
ratings of wine samples by going through the entire data
analysis process and building more skill with Python for data
analysis.

* Data Analysis Process - Case Study 2

Investigate a more challenging dataset on fuel economy and
learn more about problems and strategies in data analysis.
Continue to build on your Python for data analysis skills.

* Programming Workflow for Data Analysis

Additional content to expose you to a different workflow for
your analysis in Python: IPython's command line interface,
writing scripts in text editors, running scripts in the terminal.

### Project: Investigate a Dataset
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets, perform an investigation, and share your findings.

## Part 3: Practical Statistics

### Supporting Lessons

* Descriptive Statistics - Part I

In this lesson, you will learn about data types, measures of
center, and the basics of statistical notation.

* Descriptive Statistics - Part II

In this lesson, you will learn about measures of spread, shape,
and outliers as associated with quantitative data. You will also
get a first look at inferential statistics.

* Admissions Case Study

Learn to ask the right questions, as you learn about Simpson's
Paradox.

* Probability

Gain the basics of probability using coins and die.

* Binomial Distribution

Learn about one of the most popular distributions in
probability - the Binomial Distribution.

* Conditional Probability

Not all events are independent. Learn the probability rules for
dependent events.

* Bayes Rule

Learn one of the most popular rules in all of statistics - Bayes
rule.

* Python Probability Practice

Take what you have learned in the last lessons and put it to
practice in Python.

* Normal Distribution Theory

Learn the mathematics behind moving from a coin flip to a
normal distribution.

* Sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

Learn all about the underpinning of confidence intervals and
hypothesis testing - sampling distributions.

* Confidence Intervals

Learn how to use sampling distributions and bootstrapping to
create a confidence interval for any parameter of interest.

* Hypothesis Testing

Learn the necessary skills to create and analyze the results in hypothesis testing.

* Case Study: A/B tests

Work through a case study of how A/B testing works for an
online education company called Audacity.

* Regression

Use python to fit linear regression models, as well as
understand how to interpret the results of linear models.

* Multiple Linear Regression

Learn to apply multiple linear regression models in python.
Learn to interpret the results and understand if your model fits
well.

* Logistic Regression

Learn to apply logistic regression models in python. Learn to
interpret the results and understand if your model fits well.m

### Project: Analyze A/B Test Results
You will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to
work through to help the company understand if they should implement the new page design.
### Project: Optimize Your GitHub Profile
Other professionals are collaborating on GitHub and growing their network. Submit your profile to ensure
your profile is on par with leaders in your field.

## Part 4: Data Wrangling

### Supporting Lessons

* Introduction to Data Wrangling

Identify each step of the data wrangling process (gathering,
assessing, cleaning) through a brief walkthrough of the
process. The dataset for this lesson is an online job postings
dataset from Kaggle.

* Gathering Data

Gather data from various sources and a variety of file formats
using Python. Rotten Tomatoes ratings, Roger Ebert reviews,
and Wikipedia movie poster images make up the dataset for
this lesson.

* Assessing Data

Assess data visually and programmatically for quality and
tidiness issues using pandas. The dataset for this lesson is
mock Phase II clinical trial data for a new oral insulin called
Auralin.

* Cleaning Data
Using pandas, clean the quality and tidiness issues you
identified in the "Assessing Data" lesson. The dataset is the
same: mock Phase II clinical trial data for a new oral insulin
called Auralin.


###  Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
Showcase your wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.
### Project: Improve Your LinkedIn Profile
Find your next job or connect with industry peers on LinkedIn. Ensure your profile attracts relevant leads that
will grow your professional network.

## Part 5: Data Visualization

### Supporting Lessons

* Data Visualization in Data Analysis

In this lesson, see the motivations for why data visualization is
an important part of the data analysis process and where it fits
in.

* Design of Visualizations

Learn about elements of visualization design, especially to
avoid those elements that can cause a visualization to fail.

* Univariate Exploration of Data

In this lesson, you will see how you can use matplotlib and
seaborn to produce informative visualizations of single
variables.

* Bivariate Exploration of Data

In this lesson, build up from your understanding of individual
variables and learn how to use matplotlib and seaborn to look
at relationships between two variables.

* Multivariate Exploration of Data

In this lesson, see how you can use matplotlib and seaborn to
visualize relationships and interactions between three or more
variables.

* Explanatory Visualizations

Previous lessons covered how you could use visualizations to
learn about your data. In this lesson, see how to polish up
those plots to convey your findings to others!

* Visualization Case Study

Put to practice the concepts you've learned about exploratory
and explanatory data visualization in this case study on factors
that impact diamond prices.

### Project: Communicate Data Findings
Choose a dataset, either your own or a Udacity-curated dataset, and perform an exploratory data analysis
using Python. Then, create a presentation with explanatory plots that conveys your findings.
